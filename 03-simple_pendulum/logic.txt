first of all we define the position of line and circle.
We render it but it is not changing its position in every loop.

In a pendulum we need to determine the continuous change in angle
with respect to the origin.
Origin is the fixed point in the screen.
In the program origin is regarded as 400(width/2).
It is recommended to use the line function because rectangle will 
move the entire rectanlge in a pendulum way.That means the upper part 
must be fixed to the origin.

Create a float angle.
the angle must increment in each loop
before that we create x,y coordinate for the line and circle
and change the positon based on x,y coordinate we get.

To determine the x,y we need a little bit of science and mathematics.

If you move the line in certain angle then you will see a right angle
triangle and now from pythagoras theorem.
x=length of the line * sin(angle)
y=length of the line * cos(angle)

now we just need to change the coordinates.
But we find that it moves in circle.

Because we have not included the force which acts backward in pendulum.
I have not included the physics over here but the equation we
need to add is 
accelearation = -some constant value * sin(angle)
and we just need to increment velocity,acceleration as program.
So multiplying velocity with 0.99999 just causes it to decrease 
its velocity with time.
